        <div class="block" id="first">
            <div class="name">Assassin's Creed</div>
            <div class="info">The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events, taking place primarily during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land in 1191. The player character is a modern-day man named Desmond Miles who, through a machine called the "Animus",
                relives the genetic memories of his ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad. Through this plot device, details emerge about a millennia-old struggle between two factions: the Assassin Brotherhood (inspired by the real-life Order of Assassins), who
                fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templar Order (inspired by the Knights Templar military order), who seek to establish peace through order and control. Both factions fight over powerful artifacts of mysterious origins known
                as "Pieces of Eden" to gain an advantage over each other. The 12th-century portion of the story follows Altaïr, an Assassin, who embarks on a quest to regain his honor after failing to recover one such artifact from the Templars; he does
                so by finding and assassinating nine targets across the Holy Land. Gameplay focuses on using Altaïr's combat, stealth, and parkour abilities to defeat enemies and explore the environment. The game features counter-based hack and slash
                combat, "social stealth" (the ability to use crowds of people and the environment to hide from enemies), and a large open world comprising various regions of the Holy Land; primarily the cities of Masyaf, Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus,
                all of which have been accurately recreated to fit the game's time period. While most of the game takes place within a simulation based on Altaïr's memories, the player will occasionally be forced out of the Animus to play as Desmond in
                the modern day. Here, they are restricted to a single room they can explore, as Desmond has been kidnapped by a shady corporation who are looking for specific information within Altaïr's memories that will further their own enigmatic goals.
                Upon release, Assassin's Creed received generally positive reviews, with critics praising its storytelling, visuals, art design, and originality, although the game was also criticized for the repetitive nature of its gameplay. Assassin's
                Creed won several awards at E3 in 2006, as well as several end-year awards after its release. The game spawned two spin-offs: Assassin's Creed: Altaïr's Chronicles (2008) and Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines (2009), which exclude the modern-day
                aspect and focus entirely on Altaïr. A direct sequel, Assassin's Creed II, was released in November 2009. The sequel continues the modern-day narrative following Desmond, but introduces a new storyline set during the Italian Renaissance
                in the late 15th century, and a new protagonist, Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Since the release and
                <div class="center">success of Assassin's Creed II, subsequent games have been released, with various other Assassins and time periods.</div>

            <div class="name">Assassin's Creed II</div>
            <div class="info">Assassin's Creed II is a direct sequel to the first game, and was released in November 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in March 2010 for Windows, and in October 2010 for OS X. The modern-day narrative again follows Desmond, who escapes
                from Abstergo (revealed at the end of the previous game as a front for the modern-day Templars) with the aid of Assassin mole Lucy Stillman and is taken to her team's hideout. Hoping to train Desmond as an Assassin, they put him in the
                Animus 2.0, where he begins to suffer from the "bleeding effect"; this allows Desmond to gain his ancestors' skills, but it also damages his mind, as he begins to involuntarily experience flashes of his ancestors' memories outside of the
                Animus. Meanwhile, the main narrative takes place at the height of the Italian Renaissance in the late 15th century, and follows Desmond's Italian ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from Florence who is forced to become
                an Assassin after his father and brothers are killed by the Templars. During his journey to avenge their deaths, Ezio makes allies such as Leonardo da Vinci and Caterina Sforza, and combats enemies such as the Pazzi and Barbarigo families
                and Rodrigo Borgia. Ezio also comes into contact with technology left behind by the First Civilization, a race that created humanity and the Pieces of Eden, and who were wiped out by a catastrophic event. Similar to the first game, Assassin's
                Creed II incorporates historical events into its narrative, and features recreations of several cities from the time period it is set in (in this case, Florence, Venice, Forlì, San Gimignano, and Monteriggioni). Missions are divided into
                main story missions, themselves divided into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio's life, and side missions which can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series.
                The Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni, which acts as the Assassins' headquarters for most of the game, provides several functions which can be expanded on by paying for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons,
                and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will
                <div class="center">generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items.</div>

            <div class="name">Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</div>
            <div class="info">Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the sequel to Assassin's Creed II, and was released in November 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in March 2011 for Windows, and in May 2011 for OS X. The game begins immediately after the events of its
                predecessor, at the end of which Desmond was warned by Minerva, a member of the First Civilization, about a solar flare that will hit the Earth and kill humanity in a few months. Desmond and his team travel to Monteriggioni, where they
                set up a new a base and use the Animus to find the temple of Juno, another First Civilization member, which houses Ezio's own Apple of Eden and the key to stopping the solar flare. The main narrative continues the story of Ezio, who travels
                to Rome, the center of Templar power in Italy, to re-establish the Assassin Brotherhood there and defeat the Borgias, who have attacked Monteriggioni and stolen the Apple of Eden. Brotherhood shares many of the same features as the previous
                game though it takes place primarily in one city: Rome. Similar to the Villa Auditore, the player is able to spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city as to increase revenue they can collect from it;
                however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so. The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player
                can invite these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money, or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game
                features online multiplayer. Players play as Abstergo employees, who, through the use of the Animus, take on the genetic memories of Renaissance
                <div class="center">Templars in various game modes. It was the last game to feature Assassin's Creed creator Patrice Désilets, as the creative director of the series.</div>

                kill Lucy (who, unbeknownst to him, was a Templar double agent), Desmond has fallen into a coma and was put back into the Animus to save his mind. Within the computerized "core" of the Animus, Desmond meets the preserved consciousness
                of Abstergo's previous Animus test subject, Clay Kaczmarek, who explains that Demond's mind must achieve full synchronization with Altaïr and Ezio, or else he will fall into dementia. Desmond continues exploring the memories of Ezio, who,
                a few years after the events of Brotherhood, travels to Constantinople to find five keys needed to open a vault built by Altaïr, which is said to contain the power to end the Assassin-Templar conflict. In Constantinople, Ezio becomes caught
                in a feud between the Ottomans and Byzantines, and discovers that the Templars are also searching for the keys. The game also continues Altaïr's story after the first game, as the keys allow Ezio to witness Altaïr's memories to learn more
                about his life. Originally Revelations was announced as Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy, and conceptualized as a Nintendo 3DS title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf to explore Altaïr's legacy and uncover the origins of the Assassin Brotherhood.
                Sections of the game's plot and premise later became the foundation for Assassin's Creed: Revelations. However, on July 15, 2011, Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy was announced as cancelled. The reason behind the cancellation was that Ubisoft
                had decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original plot remained,
                and evolved into the plot seen in the final game, which became Assassin's Creed: Revelations. Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting. The multiplayer mode returned in Revelations, with
                <div class="center"> more characters, modes, and maps, and by advancing up through levels of experience, the player learns more about Abstergo's history.</div>

            <div class="name">Assassin's Creed III</div>
            <div class="info">Assassin's Creed III was released in October 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in November 2012 for Wii U and Windows. A remastered version of the game with enhanced visuals was released for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One
                in March 2019, and for Nintendo Switch in May 2019. This is the final game in the series to follow Desmond, who travels to the First Civilization's central temple in New York with his friends and father to stop the solar flare that will
                hit the Earth in less than a month. Inside, they discover advanced technology that could help them achieve this, but they need to acquire power sources to power the temple, including one in the possession of Abstergo, leading to a final
                confrontation between Desmond and his former captors. During this time, Desmond enters the Animus several times to deal with his dissociative fugue, and experiences the memories of his ancestor, Haytham Kenway, a British Templar from the
                18th century who is sent to the American Colonies to establish a strong Templar presence on the continent and find the First Civilization's central temple. Later, the perspective changes to Haytham's half-Mohawk son Ratonhnhaké:ton (later
                renamed "Connor"), who becomes an Assassin after his village is destroyed, seemingly on the orders of the Templar Charles Lee. After training under the retired Assassin Mentor Achilles Davenport, Connor seeks revenge against Lee, and becomes
                involved in the American Revolution, which leads him to ally with the Revolutionaries led by George Washington and battle the Templar Order, now led by his father. Assassin's Creed III is structured similarly to the previous games, with
                missions taking place in an open-world map based on Colonial Boston and New York. The game offers a large wilderness area in the form of the Frontier and the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which subsequently
                can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles were introduced, wherein the player must steer a warship named Aquila in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and
                <div class="center">mounted guns. The modern-day aspects of the story were significantly expanded, and feature actual missions that the player must undertake to progress through the story.</div>

            <div class="info">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag was released in October 2013 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U, and in November 2013 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. Following the events of Assassin's Creed III, at the end of which Desmond
                sacrificed himself to save the Earth, Abstergo has retrieved samples from his body to continue exploring the memories of his ancestors. The player character is an unnamed Abstergo employee tasked with analyzing the memories of Edward Kenway,
                a famous 18th century pirate and Connor's grandfather, ostensibly to gather material for an Animus-powered video game; in reality, however, Abstergo are searching for the Observatory, a First Civilization structure that allows the user
                to see through the eyes of a subject to find them anywhere on the planet. As Edward, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the British, Spanish and French empires into locating the "Sage" – later
                identified as Bartholomew Roberts – who is the only man that can lead them to the Observatory. Black Flag retains many gameplay mechanics from Assassin's Creed III, including the ship-based exploration and combat. For the first time in
                the series, naval exploration is a major part of the game; players can captain Edward's ship, the Jackdraw, and battle rival ships or hunt sea animals. The game includes a large open world spanning the West Indies, with players able to
                explore
                <div class="center"> the cities of Havana, Nassau, and Kingston, as well as numerous islands, forts, and sunken ships.</div>

            <div class="name">Assassin's Creed: Rogue</div>
            <div class="info">
                Assassin's Creed Rogue is the final game in the series to be developed for the seventh generation of consoles, being released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2014,[15] and for Windows in March 2015.[16] A remastered version of the game
                was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2018. In the present-day, players again take on the role of an unnamed Abstergo employee, who is tasked researching the memories of Shay Patrick Cormac, an Assassin from the 18th
                century who defected to the Templars. During their investigation, the player accidentally trips a hidden memory file that infects the Animus servers, and must complete Shay's memories to clean the servers while Abstergo is put in lockdown.
                The main narrative takes place during the Seven Years' War,[15] and follows Shay, who, after becoming disillusioned with the Assassins' tactics, joins the Templars and helps them hunt down former members of his Brotherhood during their
                search for the Pieces of Eden. The story is set between the events of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed III, and is meant to "fill the gaps" between their respective narratives, while also having "a crucial link to the
                Kenway saga", as well as to Assassin's Creed Unity.[17] Several major characters from III and Black Flag make appearances in the game, such as Haytham Kenway, Achilles Davenport, and Adéwalé.[18] In March 2014, a new Assassin's Creed game
                code-named Comet was revealed to be in development for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, set to release later that year alongside Unity. By the end of the month, additional reports indicated that Comet would be set around 1758 New York City,
                and would feature sailing on the Atlantic Ocean. The game would be a direct sequel to Black Flag, and would be the first to feature a Templar as the main protagonist, named Shay. In May 2014, Guillemot stated that Assassin's Creed games
                would continue releasing on the last generation PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 "for the foreseeable future", despite the franchise moving to the current generation PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with Unity.[20] On August 5, Ubisoft announced the
                game as Assassin's Creed Rogue. In addition to being a sequel to Black Flag, the game also retains most of its gameplay mechanics, including the ship-based exploration and combat.
                <div class="center">Although a few new features were added, Rogue was ultimately criticized for having too many similarities to Black Flag and failing to innovate the series' formula.</div>

                Abstergo, who hope to use their unware playerbase to locate more Pieces of Eden. While playing, the player is contacted by the modern-day Assassins, and invited to join them as an Initiate and help them locate the body of an 18th-century
                Sage. The main story is set in Paris during the French Revolution, and follows Assassin Arno Dorian as he attempts to avenge his foster father's death at the hands of the Templars, which leads him to discover an internal conflict between
                the Templars as a result of the Revolution. On March 19, 2014, images leaked for the next Assassin's Creed game, titled or code-named Unity, showing a new assassin in Paris. On March 21, Ubisoft confirmed the game's existence, having been

            <div class="info">Assassin's Creed Syndicate was released in October 2015 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, in November 2015 for Windows,and in December 2020 for the Stadia. In the present-day, players control the same unnamed Assassin Initiate from Assassin's
                Creed Unity, who this time must help the Assassins locate a powerful artifact, the Shroud of Eden, hidden somewhere in London. The main story is set in Victorian era London and follows twin assassins Jacob and Evie Frye as they navigate
                the corridors of organized crime, and gradually take back the city from Templar control. In December 2014, images and information leaked for a new Assassin's Creed game, titled or code-named Victory, which was later confirmed by Ubisoft.
                In May 2015, Kotaku leaked that Victory had been renamed Syndicate. On May 12, 2015, the game was officially announced by Ubisoft. The game retains several gameplay elements from Unity, and introduces new travelling systems, such as carriages
                and a grappling hook, and refined combat mechanics. It is the first game in the series to feature multiple

                <div class="center">playable protagonists, whom the player can switch between both during and outside missions.</div>

            <div class="name">Assassin's Creed: Origins</div>
            <div class="info">Assassin's Creed Origins is a soft reboot of the franchise, and was released in October 2017 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, and Stadia. The game introduces a new protagonist in the modern-day, Layla Hassan, and explores the origins
                of the Assassin Brotherhood and their conflict with the Templar Order. The story is set in Ancient Egypt, near the end of the Ptolemaic period (49–43 BC), and follows a Medjay named Bayek and his wife Aya, whose fight to protect their
                people from the Order of the Ancients—forerunners to the Templar Order—leads them to create the Hidden Ones—forerunners to the Assassin Brotherhood. The game features a large open world, and puts more emphasis on the series' role-playing
                elements, introducing an overhauled "hitbox-based" combat system. In February 2016, Ubisoft announced they would not be releasing a new game in 2016 in order to step "back and the Assassin's Creed franchise... year to evolve the game mechanics
                and to make sure we're delivering on the promise of Assassin's Creed offering unique and memorable gameplay experiences". On the decision, Guillemot said that "Ubisoft started to question the annualized franchise with the release of Assassin's
                Creed Unity, and the fact that Assassin's Creed Syndicate had "a slower launch than expected". Guillemot added that "by moving away from the annual iterations of the franchise, it will give the Assassin's Creed teams more time to take
                advantage of new engines and technology". Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag's director Ashraf Ismail, commented on an interview that he and the team would be interested in doing an Assassin's Creed game in an Ancient Egyptian setting, along
                with reiterating an earlier statement that a female leading character was not an impossibility for the series. In
                <div class="center">May 2017, Ubisoft confirmed the development of Assassin's Creed Origins; one month later, the setting was confirmed to be Ptolemaic Egypt.

            <div class="info">Assassin's Creed Valhalla was released in November 2020 for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Windows, Stadia, and Luna. The game concludes the modern-day story arc focusing on Layla, who must find a First Civilization
                temple in Norway to restore the Earth's magnetic field to its proper strength, since Desmond's sacrifice in Assassin's Creed III only delayed the apocalypse. The main narrative takes place in the late 9th century, during the Viking expansions
                into the British Isles. Players control a customizable Viking raider, Eivor Varinsdottir, who becomes embroiled in the conflict between the Hidden Ones and the Order of the Ancients while attempting to establish a new Viking clan in England.
                Valhalla was officially announced in April 2020. Ubisoft Montreal led its development along with fourteen other Ubisoft studios. The title had been leaked earlier in April 2019 under the name Assassin's Creed Kingdom.Like Origins and Odyssey,
                it is a role-playing video game with a focus on combat and exploration, but retains most of the traditional gameplay
                <div class="center">elements of the series, including the return of social stealth.
